Website that shows women average salaries to encourage them to be assertive when demanding pay in various careers. 
Users will fill out a form that asks for position, YOE (potentially), and location. Upon filling out the form, the
website will return the average salary of that job, as well as an estimation of the gender pay gap. It will then offer
a recommended negotiated salary.
